# ILS: An R package for statistical analysis in Interlaboratory Studies


<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Overview

The main objective of the ILS package is to detect laboratories that provide not consistent
results, working simultaneously with different test materials, from the perspective
of the Univariate Data Analysis and the Functional Data Analysis (FDA).

The ILS package can identify laboratories that provide significantly different
results through the estimation the Mandel’s h and k scalar statistics, based
on the ASTM E691 and ISO 5725-2 standards. Additionally, the package has implemented
tools to assess the presence of outliers using the Cochran and Grubbs tests.

Furthermore, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) techniques are provided, both for the
cases of fixed and random effects, including confidence intervals for the
principles parameters.

On the other hand, One of the novelties of this package is the incorporation of
tools to perform an ILS from a functional data analysis approach. Accordingly, the
functional nature of the data obtained by experimental techniques corresponding
to analytical chemistry, applied physics and engineering applications (spectra,
thermograms, and sensor signals, among others) is taking into account by implementing
the functional extensions of Mandel’s h and k statistics.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ILSR6V1 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("ILSR6V1")
library("ILSR6V1")
```

## Concepts across the board

**ILS package** addresses several concepts and approaches which will be discussed
in detail in the later sections of this article. The most relevant concepts can be
found below:

-   **Interlaboratory Study (ILS)**:

```{r GUIfig, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  library(png)
  library(grid)
  library(knitr)
  img <- readPNG("ILS_Overview.PNG")
  grid.raster(img)
```

    This concept can be defined as a control procedure to
    evaluate the performance of a group of laboratories through a collaborative
    trials. In an Interlaboratory Study, an adequate number of laboratories are
    chosen to participate in the experiment with the aim of analyzing the samples
    and obtain results.
    
    Participating laboratories receive samples (previously homogenized or to be
    homogenized by the laboratories) for analysis, then, the measurements results of
    the laboratories are evaluated according to the degree of data variability. Some
    of the most common factors that may be a cause of variability are: the equipment
    of laboratories, operators, materials, temperature and humidity, among others.

-   **R6-based design**: uses R6 classes for flexibility and performance.
-   **Interactive graphics**: modern visualizations with **ggplot2** and **plotly**.
-   **tidyverse integration**: easy data manipulation and visualization.


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ILSR6V1)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
